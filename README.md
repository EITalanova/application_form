# **Aplication_form**

**The following technologies were used:**
- JavaScript(ES6)
- CSS
- HTML
  
The form allows you to select multiple options in a field. The form was implemented using a button and a block with answer options.
When selecting, options are formed in the selection field and, if necessary, transferred to another line (the implementation option was chosen not separated by commas, but in blocks for a better visual effect).
The selection field also has a movable placeholder.
